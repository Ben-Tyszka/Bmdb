# Bmbd
A small movie data web application
The production branch is deployed [here](https://bmdb-bty.firebaseapp.com/) 
## About
Bmdb is written in [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) with the [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) framework. It uses [Angular Material components](https://github.com/angular/material2) to improve the look and feel of the application. Bmdb uses the [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) json api to search for and retrieve movie data.
## Goals
* Use Typescript and Angular to create a modern and professional web application
* Follow test driven development standards
* Utilize CI/CD technologies
